  * You should never commit this file to a public repository on GitHub!
  * All public code on GitHub can be searched, that means anyone can see your
  * uploaded email.js file.
  *
  * I did it for your convenience using "throw away" configurations
  * that all features could work out of the box.
  *
  * Use config vars (environment variables) below for production values has a way
  * for you to set it up from the dashboard.
  *
  * Another added benefit of this approach is that you can use two different
  * sets of keys for local development and production mode without making any
  * changes to the code.
